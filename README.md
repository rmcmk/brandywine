# Brandywine

Brandywine aims to provide a simple, elegant, robust and easy to use framework utilizing the latest and greatest Java features, here is how we will keep you covered...
* Embracing Java's type system in the fullest, restricting unwanted behaviors at _compile time_
* Providing always readily extensive interfacing so that implementation detail doesn't hold back future potentials
* Wisely structuring the codebase to allow instant notional understandment and promote modularity
* No implicity - we'll explicitly state requirements (whether such statements are forced by code itself or documented) to ensure a surprise-free library for ourselves and other developers
* Listen for extensive review and feedback to coordinate future development plans of infrastructure - large or small
* Giving you our one and only plugin system; bringing light to dynamic unattached event dispatches in the community
